This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

First build the node modules and package-lock.json by running<br />
--> npm install

Then run any of below two commands:-

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run dev`

It will build the client-side app, bundle and transpile the server code, and start up the server on :3000.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you will see server-side rendered app.
